an abandoned javascript clicker game i made that was going to just be filled with terrible memes and cliches

development came to a standstill when i fell out of love with clicker games

right now i guess its a cool exquisite corpse generator (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse)

  - there are 6 heads, 7 torsos, and 6 legs, for 252 combinations

*all its good for is refreshing the page to see a cool new picture*

# file structure

index.html : the bare-bones webpage

main.css : the css

main.js : the javascript for most gameplay elements

boss.js : the javascript for randomization of boss name and appearance

/images : where the image files for each body part for the boss is saved.
